# JMPortfolio

An updated portfolio, still in the works. Stoked to turn this into React.



I ran into some issues with open in browser not working. So I was using githubs deploy feature to check what changes I was doing. Ended up giving me a lot more pushes than I would normally.

I'm not sure I've fulfilled the necessary requirements of this assignment. I couldn't find the ReadME in the class repo. I think I remember the requirements and tried to fulfill them based on that memory.
